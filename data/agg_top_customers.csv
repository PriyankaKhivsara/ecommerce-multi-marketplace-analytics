The contents of the file /multi_marketplace_pipeline/data/agg_top_customers.csv should be structured as a CSV file. Here is a sample structure for the `agg_top_customers.csv` file:

customer_id,customer_name,total_spent,order_count
1,John Doe,1500.00,10
2,Jane Smith,1200.50,8
3,Bob Johnson,900.75,5
4,Alice Williams,850.00,7
5,Charlie Brown,700.25,4

This is a hypothetical example; you should replace the data with the actual aggregated data for top customers as needed.
